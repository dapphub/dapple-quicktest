DAPPLE-QUICKTEST(1)         Dapple Subcommands         DAPPLE-QUICKTEST(1)


NAME
	dapple-quicktest - run Dapple tests quickly using Parity
SYNOPSIS
        dapple-quicktest [-r <filter>] [--skip-build] [-v|--verbose]

DESCRIPTION
	Quicktest is an EVM test runner written in JavaScript that rips
	through Dapple tests using a Parity-based tool called ethrun(1).

	While it's intended to be a drop-in replacement for `dapple test',
	it currently only supports a subset of the old functionality.

        On the other hand, some new features are now supported instead.

INSTALLATION
        Use `make link' to install from source:
